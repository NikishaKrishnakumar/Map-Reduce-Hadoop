Map-Reduce-Hadoop
=================

Implemented the Map-Reduce logic in Java and calculated the timing for various combination of mapper and reducers. The flat file is of 108 MB in size and consisted of 103962 records and contained information regarding the recalls of vehicles in the US for the last few decades. 
The timings were recorded for different mappers and reducers i.e (1,1) ,(2,1), (2,2) ,(10,1) and (10,2) along with the results for the following questions:

1.For each manufacturer: GM, Ford, Toyota, etc find how many recalls.

2.How many cars were recalled for each year... That is for 2014, 2013, etc recalls in total

3.Then for each year recalls for Tesla, GM, etc.

4.Identify (for years and models) the causes of those recalls: Tires,Transmission, computer, seat belts, etc.
